## R Markdown

This is an R Markdown document. Markdown is a simple formatting syntax for authoring HTML, PDF, and MS Word documents. For more details on using R Markdown see [this link](<http://rmarkdown.rstudio.com>).

When you click the **Knit** button a document will be generated that includes both content as well as the output of any embedded R code chunks within the document. You can embed an R code chunk like this:

```{r mtcars 1}
summary(mtcars)
mtcars
```

## New subset for cars that have 4 cylinders
```{r mtcars 2}
summary(as.factor(mtcars$cyl))
cylinder<- mtcars[,2, drop=FALSE]
four_cyl<- subset(cylinder, cyl == 4)
four_cyl
```
## Plot the relationship between gas mileage and engine displacement for the subset (4cylinders)
```{r mtcars 3}
mpg_fourcyl<- mtcars[ c(1:3)]
four_cyl1<- subset(mpg_fourcyl, cyl == 4)
mpg1 <- four_cyl1$mpg
disp1 <- four_cyl1$disp
plot(mpg1, disp1)

```



## New subset for cars that have 6 cylinders
```{r mtcars 4}
summary(as.factor(mtcars$cyl))
cylinder6<- mtcars[,2, drop=FALSE]
six_cyl <- subset(cylinder6, cyl == 6)
six_cyl
```
## Plot the relationship between gas mileage and engine displacement for the subset (6cylinders)
```{r mtcars 5}
mpg_sixcyl<- mtcars[ c(1:3)]
six_cyl1<- subset(mpg_sixcyl, cyl == 6)
mpg2 <- six_cyl1$mpg
disp2 <- six_cyl1$disp
plot(mpg2, disp2)
```
